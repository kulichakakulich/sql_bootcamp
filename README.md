# SQL Bootcamp

### Bootcamp Description
This bootcamp focuses on exploring the basic and advanced features of relational databases and SQL. It includes concepts such as data querying, data manipulation, data modeling, database transactions, and more. Additionally, the project demonstrates the practical application of SQL in solving various problems, including the Traveling [Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

### Technologies Used
The bootcamp uses a relational database management system PostgreSQL, to implement the database. SQL is used as the primary language for data manipulation and querying. Additionally, utilizes OLAP constructions and functional blocks to extract insights from data.

### Challenges Faced
#### The bootcamp presented several challenges, including:
- Designing an efficient and scalable database schema
- Implementing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from data
- Ensuring database transactions' consistency and isolation levels
- Optimizing database performance through the creation of indexes
- Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using SQL

### Unique Aspects of the Bootcamp
>The bootcamp's unique aspect is the practical application of SQL in solving the Traveling [Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). The solution showcases how SQL can be used to solve complex optimization problems that would typically require dedicated software or algorithms.
